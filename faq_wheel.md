# INTRO

The conditions allowed in `wheelcompendium search` are not final in that more may be added, or the syntax may be changed depending upon community needs. Nothing will be subtracted. This document will stay up to date with changes.

The command signature:

`!wheelcompendium [search|s] ([logicexpr|logic]=all) ([condition|cond|c]=...) ([time|version]=syndicated) ([dateformat|format]=%m/%d/%y)`

The custom logic is identical to `lineup search` on the Price is Right side of the bot, refer to that pastebin for more.

Currently, only syndicated puzzles are in wayo.py's version of the compendium (e.g. the `time` parameter of the command does nothing). Extra info such as unused BR category choices in the modern era and puzzles from other versions will be added in due time.

Examples given below have output truncated for length.

# TRUE/FALSE SPECIFICATION

To specify a true in a condition, use one of the following words (case-insensitive): yes, y, true, t, 1. For false: no, n, false, f, 0.

# SEPARATING "WORDS" IN A CONDITION

Conditions are "words" separated by semicolons (`;`). You can have up to 26 conditions, labeled A-Z in custom logic. This is more strict than `lineup search` because `,` shows up in a few bonus answers on puzzles (and I used that liberty to use `,` in some forms of words). The first word corresponds to the type of query, each of which has a dedicated section below. All condition text will be translated to uppercase. The first word corresponds to the type of query, each of which has a dedicated section below. Some conditions have secondary "subconditions" as the second word.

# COLUMNS

Condition types mostly correspond to filtering data based on a column. wayo.py's compendium has the following columns on the data:

- season `S`, from 1 to 39 (and onward!)
- date `DATE`, the airdate / intended date (alias `D`)
- overall episode number `EP`
- episode of the season `E/S` (alias `ES`), this is calculated by wayo.py
- date / episode number uncertainty `UC`
- round `ROUND` (alias `RD`)
- `PP` marker for prize puzzle
- `RL` marker for red letter puzzle
- `PR` marker for puzzler
- the actual puzzle, `PUZZLE` (alias `P`)
- the category, `CATEGORY` (alias `CAT`)
- `CLUE/BONUS`, the bonus money question for certain categories, or crossword clue (aliases `CLUE`, `BONUS`, `CB`, `B`)

# NUMBER EXPRESSIONS

For any condition based on a (calculated) whole number, the following can be put as a word of the condition:

- `N`, equal to N. Can also be written as `=N`
- `N1,N2,...`, equal to one of N1,N2 ...
- `~=N`, not equal to N
- `>N`, greater than N
- `<N`, less than N
- `>=N`, at least N
- `<=N`, at most N
- `[N1,N2]`, between N1 and N2 inclusive
- `(N1,N2)`, between N1 and N2 exclusive
--the `[]` and `()` can be mixed and matched for inclusive / exclusive on those bounds. This matches conventional mathematical notation describing ranges.

Any of these sub-words above can be combined in the same condition. Any one of them being true will then match the condition.

# STRING EXPRESSIONS

A string in programming terms is, pretty much, simply an alias for text. Obviously there is a lot of text every row in the compendium. For conditions involving text:

- `regex`, there is a match of `regex` within the entire string.
--Regular expressions are very powerful and you can get a lot out of your searchs if you learn the basics: https://regexone.com https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html
- `regex;num`. There are `num` number of matches of `regex` within the entire string. `num` can be any number expression from the previous section. (So `regex` is simply shorthand for `regex;>=1`.)

Any of these sub-words above can be combined in the same condition. Any one of them being true will then match the condition. A lot of "any of these being true" can be done implicitly if regular expressions are leveraged correctly.

## LITERALS & EXACT

For the string columns, the following can be appended right after the `regex` word in the condition, as its own additional word in the condition:

- `LITERAL`, `LIT`, `L`: Look that the column in question has the given text somewhere in it, with no regular expressions applied, essentially just turning `regex` into `text`.
- `EXACT`, `E`: Look that the column in question is exactly the given text.

These are helpers to ignore regular expressions if so desired.

# S, EP, E/S

These columns are whole numbers, so any combo of number expressions can be done on them.

These are "boolean" columns in that they're either True or False. So simply `cond=column` looks if the puzzle is marked with this column, `cond=column;False` looks if the row is specifically not marked with this column. (`cond=column;True` is also allowed, but there is the shorthand above.) And any alias for True/False as per the top of this document is allowed.

Note that in output, since there can be a long output and there is only one header line, if True the row will just repeat the column name in that spot to signify True. Also, if all of a column is False in a search result, it will be omitted from the output.

# ROUND, CATEGORY

These are string (text) columns. TBD: The option of enumerations like Pricing Games on the Price side of the bot.

Here are some helpful regular expressions to get you started on `ROUND`:

- All tossup categories: search for `T` in `ROUND`
- All regular round categories: search for `R` in `ROUND` (note the preview puzzle (`PP`) in S17 as an exception)
- All post-tossup maingame rounds: `R[4-7]`
- All puzzles but BR: `^[^B]` (does not start with a B).(Alternatively, custom logic with a NOT on `BR`)

And some more on `CATEGORY`:
- for singular or plural on most categories: end with `S?` (once or not at all on the `S`)
- THING(S) but NOT LIVING: `^THINGS?` (starts with TH...)
- PERSON or PEOPLE: `(PERSON|PEOPLE)` (can be shorthanded as `^PE[RO]`, starts with `PER` or `PEO`)
- CROSSWORD or MEGAWORD: `WORD$` (ends with `WORD`)

# PUZZLE, CLUE / BONUS

These are string (text) columns.

Here are some helpful regular expressions to get you started here:

- Any vowel: `[AEIOU]`
- Any consonant: `[^AEIOU]` (not a vowel essentially)

For the BONUS, it can be queried as a boolean column to signify a non-empty string or not (NOT possible with CLUE, even though both sets of data are in the same column - you can just search for CROSSWORD in a category query in that case, it is 1-to-1). Regular expressions aren't as meaningful here as puzzles but can still be used for advanced filtering, like any string column.
