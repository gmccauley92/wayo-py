# COMMAND OPTIONS

At the end of each parameter list for many commands, varying options can be set in a **key=value** format, in any order. In general coding terms these are usually called keyword-only arguments.

The help command shows the command signature and exactly what options are available per command, including all available aliases. For example:

	!help p c
    ![played|playings|playing|play|p] [concurrence|conflict|c] <pg1> <pg2> [pg3] [pg4] [pg5] [pg6] 
    ([byseason|by]=0) ([showlineup|show]=False) ([sortby|sort]=prod) (since=False)
    ([excludeeducated|exclude]=False) ([pgflags|flags|f])
    ([time|version]=daytime) (start=46) (end=50) ([dateformat|format]=%m/%d/%y)

First, the help was invoked with a shorthand **p c**. Any command/subcommand can be shortened with any of the aliases, such as the above.

Two pricing games are required for concurrence, as specified by the <> arguments. But up to six are allowed (pg3-6, in [], are optional). The parenthesised () parameters afterwards are the prealluded to options, that may come in any order after all the other <> and [] arguments.

For search, each condition must start with "condition=" (can be shortened to "cond="). This is more verbose than before, but also more readable and flexible.

# TRUE/FALSE SPECIFICATION

To specify a true under the discord library I'm using (discord.py), use one of the following words (case-insensitive): yes, y, true, t, 1, enable, on. For false: no, n, false, f, 0, disable, off.

# WHAT DATASET IS USED

This covers the meaning of the **time**, **start** and **end** keyword-only options.

Start and end are most often natural numbers denoting the season number.

By default, the standard daytime dataset (S1-50) is used. If "prime" or "primetime" is submitted as the **time** parameter, the dataset will be all primetime episodes (no seasons here) instead. There are also syndicated episodes (S1-8,23).

If daytime, data is gathered from the premiere of season **start** to the finale of season **end** (or today if the current season), inclusive. Defaults for the season range are according to Guint's convention: the current season and the four most recent completed seasons. For a single season, simply input N1=N2.

For the search command, the entire daytime history is the default (S1-).

Start and end can also be dates, formatted by the **dateFormat** parameter (default m/d/yy). The date endpoints are inclusive at both ends, similar to season numbers. If only one of the two are dates, the other is converted automatically.

Depending on inactive seasons for the given game(s), the season range may automatically be reduced (only in the case of season numbers given, not dates).

# BY SEASON

For the **concurrence** and **slots** commands, you can specify a non-zero number, the bySeason option, of seasons to "break up" the results by. For example:

    !played slots L7 by=6 start=1 end=48
    Lucky $even, S1-48 (6):

            PG1  PG2  PG3  PG4  PG5  PG6  PG^  PG? |  ALL

    S37-42   54   49   40    6   26   25    0    0 |  200
    S43-48   44   30   29   11   31   27    0    0 |  172

    S1-48   586  146  111   20  143  177  314    5 | 1502

This is not compatible with the case of date start/end points.

# PGGROUPS IN SLOTS

For **slots**, you can specify a PGGroup to give one big sum, with bySeason or without:

    !played slots big3 gold triple 3x start=36 end=49 by=7
    BIG3, S36-49 (7):

By specifying onlyPGs (only) as True, all PGGroups are considered as a listing of single PGs instead, for shorthand:

    !played slots 3p start=1 end=49
    3 PRIZER, S1-49: 486, 357, 482, 830, 140, 209 | 423^, 4? | 2931

    ORP Three Furs was not played in S1.
    One Wrøng Price, S27-49: 98, 97, 83, 143, 41, 58 | 520

# SHOWING LINEUPS

In the **search** command, all matching lineups are printed automatically. If the result is over the character limit for one message (2000), a downloadable text file will be generated (that is previewable within the first 100 lines, effectively making the character limit much greater - thanks for that update in early 2021, Discord!).

In the **concurrence** command, you have the option to print all the lineups that match with the showLineup option. By default, it is false.

    !p c check 241 show=y

## SORT AND SINCE

Going further for these two commands are two more options:

You can sort the resulting lineups by date with **sort=d** or **sort=date** (case-insensitive), instead of the default, in-production-order listing (**sort=p** or **sort=prod**).

By specifying **since=True**, an additional column will appear to the right of AIRDATE when **sort=date** (only on daytime & primetime) showing the number of days since the previous line's lineup. When **sort=prod**, this column will be to the right of the production number and show the number of shows, based on production show ordering (see Valid Production Codes section below), since.

    !lineup search start=50 cond=h-l sort=date since=y

## DATES AND SEASONS

The dataset includes the intended airdate (based off of the production code) and the actual airdate. If all the intended and actual dates match in a certain output, just one column of dates will be shown, deleting the extraneous information.

If only one season is specified for the dataset, the season column will be removed.

The dataset includes notes on special shows. If there are no notes given for all shows in a certain output, the notes column will be removed.

# VALID PRODUCTION CODES

[G-R FAQ on Codes](http://www.golden-road.net/gr_faq/index.php?title=General_Questions#How_do_I_read_an_episode.27s_production_number.3F)

To date, a daytime production number will be a four-digit number (zero padding included), starting with 0011 and ending in 1-5, followed by a 'D' or 'K'. Essentially, the show began on 0011D, and once they got to 9995D they "reset" to 0011K. Therefore 0011K is essentially 10011D, and so on.

A primetime production number is one of the following: 001-006P, 0001S, 0001LV, 001-040SP (except for 39).

There are a handful of unaired episodes with odd production codes.

Malformed production codes will automatically be thrown out. All letters will be automatically transformed to uppercase.

# FLAGS

A particular playing of a PG can have one of these flags:

- **C**: non-car for a non-restored car (NCFAC), or a car game for a boat. Shows up as __car__ or __boat__ in output.
- **T**: 3+ multiprizer for trips, or in the one instance of the all-Plinko show, Plinko for a trip.
- **&**: any playing for 2 or more cars that isn't It's Optional or Triple Play. Shows up as __cars__ in output.
- **\***: A playing with rule changes just for that playing (such as a Big Money Week version of a casher, or 35th Anniversary Plinko), a LMAD Mashup game, or in two syndicated cases, a "vintage car reproduction". Note for MDS shows, an increase on the top prize on cashers was so common that these instances are not denoted with this flag.
- **@**: A playing for a restored car, or a 4-prizer played for LA sports season tickets.
- **R**: A playing for really unusual prize(s).
- **$**: Mainly a non-cash game played for cash, hence the use of the dollar sign here. In a couple instances instead, a car game for a trailer, or in the one instance of the all-Plinko show, Plinko for 2 regular prizes.
- **^**: The slotting of the game is uncertain. Some old records are incomplete and slotted by best guess.
- **?**: The identity of the game is uncertain. Some old records are incomplete and this is a best guess on what the game was. Often it is known which set of two or three games occurred within a small subset of shows, with no further certainty.
- **M**: This was the Million Dollar Game in a Drew MDS (primetime) in 2008. Shows up as __MDG__ in output.

A select couple of playings have two flags: there were two NCFAC playings that were MDGs, and one playing of "drop the ball" (rule change) Range for a car in 2021.

To give a further example on the ^ and ? flags, this was the listing for 4841D and 4842D prior to Pluto TV's airings on Feb 3rd, 2021:

            S      AIRDATE                 PG1              PG2              PG3                       PG4                  PG5              PG6

    4842D  11  Mar 15 1983     Lucky Seven (^)  Blank Check (^)  Pick a Pair (?)  Barker's Bargain Bar (^)  Five Price Tags (^)    Race Game (^)

We knew Hurdles and Pick a Pair were on these two shows, just not exactly which order. It turned out the "best guess" on these GPs was wrong:

            S      AIRDATE             PG1         PG2            PG3           PG4                   PG5              PG6

# UNKNOWN GAMES

There are 7 instances of truly missing games, that go beyond the **?** flag above. Thanks to Pluto TV, some prior instances have been resolved, and the latest instance now is season 5.

The "unknown" PG cannot be used in slots or conflict; it is mostly there for completion's sake.

# THE SEARCH COMMAND

Search is a much more powerful form of conflict and slots. Only by default will search will simply give the conflict of any number of games, its true use is for custom logic.

Each condition in a search is a PG or PGGroup (see later section in this doc), followed by any combination of slots the PG or PGGroup must be in to match, followed by any combination of flags the PG playing must have at least one of to match, followed by any combination of the number of playings the PG, or a PG within a PGGroup, must have in one lineup to match. By default, any slot, flag or count (frequency) is matched.

With only one instance in the dataset of a PG playing with two flags (the aforementioned Safe MDG), flag searching is simplified to just "have any one of the given flags".

As mentioned in the help command, each "condition" after setting up the dataset and logic is a 4-tuple of words (separated by a comma or semicolon), with all but the PG optional: pricing game or pricing game group, slots, flags, and counts. The format is

>cond=(pg|pggroup),s[slots],f[flags],c[counts]

where [slots] and [counts] each is any combo of 123456, no repeats, [flags] is any combo of __0CT&^*@R$^?M__, no repeats. Flag "0" corresponds to a regular playing with no actual flags.

Specifying slots with one of the __^?__ flags will result in an error: these flags by definition imply uncertain slotting.

## EXAMPLE 1: SLOTS & FLAGS

For example, to search for all lineups with Punch in the first half and Balance Game for a car in the second half:

    !search cond=punch,s123 cond=balance,s456,fC

    1 lineup found in S1-49 for all of
    * Punch a Bunch played 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
    * Balance Game played 4th, 5th, or 6th, with the "C" flag

            S      AIRDATE           PG1            PG2       PG3           PG4                 PG5        PG6
    8621K  47  Feb 11 2019  Side by Side  Punch a Bunch  Cover Up  Vend-O-Price  Balance Game (car)  Swap Meet

## EXAMPLE 2: PG WILDCARD

If any combination of dashes or stars is used in the PG part of a condition, it will match any game. This is useful when looking for all instances of certain flag(s) in a dataset, or if you just want the entire dataset.

For example, every instance of 3-prize trippers played last in S30-38:

    !l s cond=**,s6,fT start=30 end=38

     9 lineups found in S30-38 for any game played 6th, with the "T" flag
    
            S      AIRDATE                   PG1            PG2               PG3                   PG4               PG5                 PG6

## EXAMPLE 3: COUNTS

The only lineup to date that has repeated a PG is the all Plinko show. We can look for 6 occurrences of Plinko in a lineup to find it:

    !l s cond=plinko,c6

    1 lineup found in S1-49 for Plinko (x6), played in any slot
    
            S      AIRDATE    INT. DATE     PG1           PG2         PG3           PG4         PG5         PG6
    6435K  42  Sep 27 2013  Oct 04 2013  Plinko  Plinko (car)  Plinko ($)  Plinko (car)  Plinko (T)  Plinko ($)

Using a singular PG in a count condition is useless otherwise. This is where PGGroups shine.

2-prizers generally conflict with each other, but Double Cross has been played a handful of times with another one:

    !l s start=44 cond=2p,c2

    4 lineups found in S44-49 for any 2 PRIZER (x2), played in any slot

    !l s start=37 cond=1p,c456

    9 lineups found in S48 for all of

Flags and counts can be combined as well. This is most applicable to a full-on wildcard. Note searching this may take longer. Shows with exactly 2 slottings uncertain:

Finally, a neat trick to filter out half hour shows or full hour shows: *,c3 or *,c6.

## WARNINGS

There are five warnings that can appear when using search (see two sections below):

- *Missing games have uncertain slots by definition.*
Occurs when using "unknown,s#" in a condition. See below section.
- *Slotting of uncertainly slotted playings specified in a condition.*
Occurs when using "f^,s#" in a condition. A reminder that the slotting is best guess.
- *Uncertain playing flag specified in a condition. Playings marked with the ? flag belong to a lineup, at worst, that is close to the given production number.*
Occurs when using "f?" in a condition. The given lineup that matches may not be correct.
- *Slotting of uncertainly slotted playings factored into results.'*
Occurs when slotting, but not **^**, is in a condition, and at least one matching lineup has a **^** flag in a matching slot.
- *Playings marked with the ? flag belong to a lineup, at worst, that is close to the given production number.*
Occurs when **?** is not in a condition, but at least one matching lineup has that **?** flag on the condition's PG/PGGroup.

## THE USE OF ANY

By default, the logic expression is __all__, where all the conditions must match. Use __any__ to make it so only one of the conditions need to match:

    !l s logic=any cond=telephone cond=professor

    5 lineups found in S1-49 for any of
    * Telephone Game played in any slot
    * Professor Price played in any slot

## FULL POWER: CUSTOM LOGIC

Custom logic is supported for up to 26 conditions (you should never need this many). When building a custom logic expression, remember that each condition is internally labeled A, B, C ... in order. The following boolean operators are allowed as simple words, or their boolean logical symbols:

- **AND, &**. all conditions must match, e.g. A & B & C for all three
- **OR, |**. any condition must match, e.g. A | B | C | D for any one of these four.
- **NOT, ~**. the condition must not match. e.g. ~ ( A | B ) for both these conditions failing.
- **XOR, ^**. exactly one condition must match out of two. e.g. ~ (A ^ B) matches either both conditions matching or both failing.
-- Technically, for n arguments to XOR, an odd number of conditions must match if n is even, or an even number of arguments must match if n is odd. In general, it's simpler to limit XOR to two conditions.

With parentheses and up to 26 conditions (letters), as well as PGGroups effectively making an OR of any set of PGs, many powerful expressions are possible.

The logic expression is allowed as one word with no spaces, but this can get unreadable fast. Surround an expression with quotes, and spaces will be allowed.

Note searching this may take longer with a complicated custom logic expression, but you can get very specific results with them - examples now follow.

Here's an example: Throughout Rent's history, how many times was it played in the first two, followed by either Dice, Card, or Money 3rd, and in the second half, Master Key was played but not Race Game?

    !l s start=39 logic=A & (B | C | D) & E & ~F cond=rent,s12 cond=dice,s3 cond=card,s3 cond=money,s3 cond=key,s456 cond=race,s456

    3 lineups found in S39-49 for 
    A & E & ~F & (B | C | D) ; where
    
    A = Pay the Rent played 1st or 2nd
    B = Dice Game played 3rd
    C = Card Game played 3rd
    D = Money Game played 3rd
    E = Master Key played 4th, 5th, or 6th
    F = Race Game played 4th, 5th, or 6th
    
            S      AIRDATE    INT. DATE              PG1           PG2         PG3             PG4           PG5           PG6

Another fun example, this time with PGGroups for even more power: there's been a dozen lineups with no GP or SP game in the show's history, discarding Let's Make a Deal games as well as one instance of an unknown game:

    !l s logic=~(A|B|C|D) cond=gp cond=sp cond=deal cond=unknown

    12 lineups found in S1-49 for 
    ~(A | B | C | D) ; where
    
    A = any GP game played in any slot
    B = any SP game played in any slot

Recently added in early 2022: in search, you can specify a regular expression with

>cond=(n|notes) REGEX

to freely search the notes column. Only one of these conditions are allowed per search, and cannot be used in custom logic (and will be skipped over as far as labeling A,B,C... etc. if used with other conditions in custom logic).

# PG GROUPS

For the search command, it is useful to define an arbitrary set of games as a PGGroup. You can use the pggroup command to make your own mappings, or use the defaults, which generally partitions every PG by type of game.

The bot comes with many single words that map to these groups. Use the **pg list_groups** and **pg groupAbbr** commands to list them, case insensitive.

# VALID PG STRINGS

Use the **pg list** and **pg abbr** commands to list every available PG, and every single "word" that maps to a PG object in my code, case insensitive. Balance Game, Bullseye, and Time is Money are considered different games between their first and second iterations.
